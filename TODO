TODO:
- add exclude/include API not related to cloud (offline of something similar). should be usable from BU
- add triggerin for hltd-libs to restart soap2file and hltd if this is updated
- investigate why python3.4 setprocname does not work (appears not to be language related). now we are using different package
- get rid of direct usage of requests and only use official Elasticsearch
